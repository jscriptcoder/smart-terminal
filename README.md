# Smart Terminal (work in progress)

Smart Terminal is a tool to interact with Smart Contracts and make RPC calls from a terminal command line. Even though it's focused on Web3 by wrapping libraries such as [@wagmi/core](https://wagmi.sh/core/getting-started), [Viem](https://viem.sh/) and [Web3Modal](https://web3modal.com/) it can be utilized for other more general purposes by enriching the list of commands.

Latest deployment: https://smart-terminal.vercel.app/

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
